# Phase transition detection without order parameters
Dataset and code for a project on the application of machine learning to phase transitions

Abstract:
Phase transitions are critical points in the thermodynamic behavior of many physical systems. Detecting phase transitions accurately is important for understanding and predicting the behavior of such systems. However, it is not always possible to obtain the order parameter for a given system, especially near the phase boundary. In this report, we propose a machine learning approach for phase transition detection, which can be applied to study the second order phase transition for the 2d Ising model without the being provided an order parameter, by employing a convolutional neural network.
